As mentioned in my Mastodon [post](https://mastodon.nz/@weiji14/112989575093074957) on the first day (you can find all my live-toots that week under the #Hackweek tag), this in-person Hackweek meant a lot to me because I've been trying for 5 years (since I found out about it during my PhD) to attend, at least the ICESat-2 track that is.
The format of the ICESat-2 Hackweek itself has evolved over the years, including a fully remote event in 2022, a hybrid event in 2023, to the 3-in-1 ICESat-2/SnowEx/GeoSMART Hackweek this 2024!
On a personal note, I've felt so fortunate to still have this opportunity to connect with the Cryosphere community, because even though I'm not strictly in academia anymore, or working with laser altimeter data in my day job, I want to make sure that the next generation of researchers have the best tools to do open science, and this Hackweek I've found is hands down the most impactful way to achieve it.

## Overall impressions

To my knowledge, this is one of the most sought after science-focused Hackathon-style events of its kind, organized mostly by folks from UW's eScience Institute which has been continuously improving their Hackweek as a Service model.
There were maybe 100-ish people attending, mainly university students at the postgraduate level and postdocs, and a quarter or so people are more seasoned veterans working at NASA's DAACs, Research Software Engineers, tenured academics, and maybe a handful of industry types.

Given the conference location and funders (NASA/NSF), the attendees were mostly from the US and Canada, with some from Europe and India, not so much from the Asia Pacific.
The demographic balance seemed pretty good, I'd reckon there was an evenly split gender balance (though there were pockets of more men in some projects), and they even had non-binary bathrooms (a first for me at a conference!).
Of course, there's still room for improvement on getting more non-white and non-male identities to the teaching ranks, but I was glad to see a student I taught two years ago lead a project this year, and would love to see more of that happen!

On the schedule side, the general format was to have lecture/interactive tutorials in the morning, and project hack-time in the afternoon.
The tutorials starts with the basics of doing Collaborative Development on a shared JupyterHub called CryoCloud, an overview of the ICESat-2/SnowEx missions, and basics of accessing those datasets in the cloud.
The more advanced or niche topics like machine learning and details of field-based instruments like LiDAR & GPR were taught near the middle of the week.
Projects involved teams from as small as 2 to 10+, and typically covered topics adjacent to someone's PhD research, to more software driven teams like [`icepyx4gedi`](https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/icepyx4gedi) which I worked on!

Overall, it does feel like we're trying to cover a lot of ground on everything from open science best practices to cloud-based workflows, machine learning, and even a session on mental health this year!
Luckily, the firehose of information is mostly all recorded so people can always go back and rewatch it, and I'm really pleased that the organizers were mindful to put in ample breaks for us to recharge or slip in a much needed conversation somewhere.
The inter-generational learning is something I can't get enough of, I've been pleasantly surprised at how good students nowadays are at using git and getting up to speed on performing tasks like searching for coincident satellite data, something which stumps even full professors!
Like-wise, it was great talking to people from the NASA DAACs on what is going behind the scenes, and getting a heads up on what's coming up.
And I can tell you now, there is a lot more to come!
